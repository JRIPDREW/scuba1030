        <p class="intro">The term scuba is an acronym for Self-Contained 
            Underwater Breathing Apparatus. The equipment that consists of this 
            aparatus include a regulator, regulators and dive tanks. This guide 
            seeks to explain the importance of the different components of 
            this aparatus and other equipment necessary for scuba diving.

        <h3>Mask</h3>
        
        <p> The whole point of scuba diving is to explore the world beneath 
            the waves and a scuba diver without a mask is a blind one. A scuba 
            diver also needs a mask so they can navigate the underwater 
            environment.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Fins</h3>
        
        <p>Fins are are a must when it comes to scuba diving. They allow a
            diver to  with ease. It would be exhausting and ineffective to 
            dive without them.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Regulator and Components</h3>
            
        <p> The regualtor and attached components are the equipment attached
            directly to the tank. This equipment provides access to the air
            in the scuba tank which a diver to uses breathe and adjust their
            buoyancy.

                in depth explanations about regulators.
            </p>
        
        <h3>BCD</h3>
       
        <p>A BCD (buyancy compensator device) is a vest like device that can 
            be inflated or deflated according to the needs of the diver. This
            allows the diver to adjust their buyancy at different depths.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Scuba Tank</h3>
        
        <p>A scuba tank is a container of highly pressurized air (about 3000 psi 
            for alluminum tanks and about 2400 psi for steel tanks). It allows
            a scuba diver to carry their air supply on their back and be 
            mobile.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Dive Weight</h3>
        
        <p>Dive weights are necessary for a scuba diver to manipulate their 
            buyancy and sink.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Dive Computer</h3>
        
        <p>A dive computer displays your depth and time spent underwater. 
            It uses the depth, time and altitude of a dive to calculate 
            how much time a diver should spend out of water between dives
            This device removes possible human error from calculating the 
            neccesary time spent between dives and thus increases diver
            safety. While not necessary for a diver to have, it is strongly
            encouraged.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Snorkel</h3>
        
        <p>Many dives will not require the use of a snorkel as the 
            actual dive is close to the access point. However, having a snorkel
            is highly recommended. If a long surface swim is required to get 
            to the dive, it is better to use a snorkel in order to conserve
            oxygen from the tank for the actual dive.
        </p>
        
        
        <h2>Diving Accessories</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Defogger
            </li>
            <li>
                Compass
            </li>
            <li>
                Line Cutter
            </li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Defogger</h3>
        
        <p>Defogger is paste that can be put on the inside of a scuba mask
            that helps prevent a mask fogging up during a dive.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Compass</h3>
        
        <p>A compass is evtremely helpful for a diver to have as it helps them 
            navigate the underwater environment without the need for 
            consistsent landmarks (landmarks are prone to move in the ocean 
            over time).
        </p>
        
        <h3>Line Cutter</h3>
        
        <p>A line cutter is good piece o equipment to have and recommended
            over dive knives. A line cutter can cut fishing line and kelp
            that a diver can get tangled in while reducing the risk of 
            damaging your own equipment (i.e. hoses and BCD).
